# IFRSCRAPER
thanks to iasplus, you no longer have to shell out $200+ on paperback ifrs... thanks to selenium, you can save time on clicking into 108 links and copying 287 pages of content manually
<br/>
*compatible with Google Chrome, Version 87.0.4280.88 (Official Build) (64-bit).*
<br/>
<br/>
## how to use
<br/>
<br/>
1. run "iaspluscrape.py"
<br/>
2. wait for webdriver to load content links, and input range ("starting number", "ending number")
<br/>
3. assuming selenium spends 5 seconds on each link, the entire operation should take less than 10 minutes to complete.
